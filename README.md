# I'm Cecilia.

And I'm a software engineer.

You might know me better by my writing alias, Daine, or my favorite username, `thewildmage`.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have professional experience as both a software quality assurance engineer and a database engineer. And I've made a hobby of front-end web development, where I advocate strongly for accessibility, inclusivity, usability, and open source.

I develop open source resources primarily for the written RPG community under a collective umbrella I call [Magrathea](https://magrathea.guide).

When I'm not helping or teaching, I'm endlessly enchanted by books and libraries, an eager seeker of adventure and challenge in video games, and a board game enthusiast and collector (132 games, 37 expansions and counting). I love a good rulebook, textbook, or bit of documentation. Ultimately, I'm a nerdy little engineer at heart; I'm fascinated to learn what makes things tick.
