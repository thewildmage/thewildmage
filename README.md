# I'm Cecilia.

And I'm a software engineer.

You might know me better by my writing alias, Daine, or my favorite username, `thewildmage`.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have professional experience as both a software quality assurance engineer and a database engineer. And I've made a hobby of front-end web development, where I advocate strongly for accessibility, usability, and open source.

I develop open source resources primarily for the written RPG community under a collective umbrella I call [Magrathea](https://magrathea.guide).

I'm also on staff over at [Coding Camp](https://discord.gg/udQ5WsqpME), a neat little Discord server community for folks of all skill levels to learn and grow through coding challenges and games geared toward written RPGs.

When I'm not helping or teaching, I'm endlessly enchanted by books and libraries, an eager seeker of adventure and challenge in video games, and a board game enthusiast and collector (120 games, 35 expansions and counting). I love a good rulebook, textbook, or bit of documentation. Ultimately, I'm a nerdy little engineer at heart; I'm fascinated to learn what makes things tick.
