# I'm `thewildmage`.

And I'm an open source software engineer.

You might know me better as Cecilia or by my writing alias, Daine. I use she/her pronouns.

I have a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Computer Science. I have professional experience as both a software quality assurance engineer and a database engineer. And I've made a hobby of front-end web development, where I advocate strongly for accessibility, inclusivity, usability, and open source.

I develop open source resources primarily for the play-by-post RPG community under a collective umbrella I call [Magrathea](https://magrathea.guide).

I think libraries are magical spaces and that there's nothing like a good video game adventure. I'm a board game enthusiast and collector (146 games, 38 expansions and counting) and an avid 3D printing hobbyist and tinkerer (fondly overseeing two Bambu Lab X1-Carbons and an upcoming Voron 2.4).  I love coffee and diving into a good rulebook, textbook, or bit of documentation. Ultimately, I'm a nerdy little engineer at heart; I'm fascinated to learn what makes things tick.
